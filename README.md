# UFOs
## A written report on the UFO analysis

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time using the following table filters: date, city, state, country, and shape.


## Results: 
Once you are in the webpage you can scroll thought the information provided, or you can use the Filter Search tool on the left side of the page. You have five options you can chose from on how you want to search for specific information. You may search for your information using one or more filters.
As shown on the picture below, you can filer by state by typing the state’s initials. For example, if you type “CO” and either click ENTER on your keyboard or click anywhere on the page away from the search bar, it will show you all the sightings in the state of Colorado.

In order to clear the filters, you may either delete what you typed and click anywhere on the page away from the search bar or refresh the page (ctrl +r).

Please keep in mind that the search tool is case sensitive. You will have to match the capitalization from the table on the right. All cities are capitalized. Example: Loveland. States and Countries are also capitalized. Example: CO, US.
If you type in “co” it won’t return anything.

## Summary: 
One drawback of this new design is that the table holding the data does not have its own scroll bar. In order to look at all the information you have to scroll away from the rest of the page. If it was held in its own section, you can scroll through the information while still having the filter search option on your left.

The two recommendations for further development would be:
  1.	To have a way to search with caps and lower case. Some users might not realize that the Filter Search is cap sensitive and might get frustrated or think that their search    did not come up with any results due to the miscommunication. 

  2.	If no searches come up with the information you provided, we should let the users know by a pop up or something written on the table stating, “no matches found”. That way they know there is no data with the information they provided instead of thinking an error occurred.
